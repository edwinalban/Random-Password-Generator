# Random-Password-Generator

## Description

I built this project for the purpose of practicing building functions in JavaScript. This project is focused primarily on the following:
Using user inputs in prompts, confirming the inputs, and concatenating the necessary information for selection based on the user's choice .
The Math.random method for randomly choosing values from the arrays after user inputs have been entered.
Displaying alerts when specific/necessary criteria has not been selected by the user.
Utilizing the push and join methods in order to update an array and display its values as a string with no separators between values.
This project can be found here: 



## Installation

## Usage

The project can be used to practice setting up arrays to be used within the function, displaying prompts, confirms, and alerts via JavaScript, concatenating information into a single location for review/selection, and randomly choosing values.
